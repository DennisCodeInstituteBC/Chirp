Using #1DA1F2 ![Sky Blue](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sky%20Blue-1DA1F2?style=flat-square&logo=Twitter&logoColor=white) in the navigation bar creates a clear focal point, guiding users toward key navigational elements. Its vibrant yet calming nature enhances readability and contrast, ensuring the interface remains user-friendly. Blue also evokes trust and reliability, making the app feel approachable and secure.

#DDDDDD ![Gray5 Color Block](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gray5-DDDDDD?style=flat-square&logoColor=black) as the body background creates a soft and clean backdrop, ensuring that content, buttons, and interactive elements stand out clearly. It also reduces strain on the eyes compared to pure white while maintaining a modern, minimalist aesthetic.

#FFFFFF ![#FFFFFF White Color Block](https://img.shields.io/badge/White-FFFFFF?style=flat-square&logoColor=black) for the content background ensures a clean, readable space that highlights user interactions. Paired with #DDDDDD ![#DDDDDD Gray5 Color Block](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gray5-DDDDDD?style=flat-square&logoColor=black) body background, it creates clear visual separation and balance.

#17BF63 ![#17BF63 Green](https://img.shields.io/badge/Green-17BF63?style=flat-square&logoColor=white) for buttons adds a vibrant, energetic touch that draws attention to interactive elements. This colour choice reinforces positive actions like submitting or following while ensuring buttons stand out against the neutral backgrounds.
